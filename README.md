# Alias

How long have you been playing in **Alias**? 
Maybe, someone feels confident that he`s good in this game. I think, this game is universal for friends, family, double date, bachelorette/bachelor party, etc. Anyway, it has one problem: sets of card are end too fast.

For this reason I **added a possibility to put on your own words** and categories in my app. We should admit that Itâ€™s not fun to guess animals all the time.

Be imaginative and find out whether your friends can guess words from chemistry or history.
